# Process Module

This module demonstrates how to build a robust background processing system within your modular platform architecture, handling both CPU and IO intensive workloads with proper monitoring and control capabilities.

## Features

1. Process Types
   - CPU-bound: Intensive computation using process pool
   - IO-bound: Async operations using thread pool
   - Mixed: Combination of both workload types
2. Real-time Monitoring
   - Progress tracking with percentage completion
   - CPU and memory usage simulation
   - Live status updates every 2 seconds
   - Resource usage visualization
3. Process Control
    - Start: Create new background processes
    - Cancel: Stop running processes gracefully
    - Retry: Restart failed processes with retry limits
    - Monitor: Real-time progress and resource tracking
4. Proper Resource Management
   - Process pool executor for CPU-bound tasks
   - Thread pool executor for IO-bound tasks
   - Cancellation tokens for clean shutdown
   - Automatic cleanup of completed processes
5. Comprehensive UI
   - Summary statistics dashboard
   - Process creation controls
   - Real-time process list with progress bars
   - Action buttons for control operations
   - Error display and retry capabilities
6. Production Ready Features
   - Proper exception handling
   - Resource cleanup on shutdown
   - Retry mechanisms with limits
   - Process isolation and sandboxing
   - Memory and performance monitoring
